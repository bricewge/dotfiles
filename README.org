#+TITLE: dotfiles
Brice Waegeneire's dotfiles for *NIX, inspired by [[https://github.com/Kraymer/F-dotfiles][Kraymer/dotfiles]].

* Tutorial
** Dependencies
This dotfiles need a minimum of dependencies, that are probablly already
availaible on your system. If it's not the case install the following packages
with your favorite package manager:
- =git=
- =sh=, any POSIX compatible shell will do
- =stow=

** Using the dotfiles as a whole
To install all the configurations at one, just enter the following in your terminal:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/bricewge/dotfiles.git
  ./dotfiles/dots
#+END_SRC

** Using part of the configurations
If you only want to use a /subset/ of the repository, let's say the
configuration just for =tmux= and =git=, then write the following in your
terminal:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/bricewge/dotfiles.git
  ./dotfiles/dots tmux git
#+END_SRC
